This notebook contains an analysis of replicate sequencing runs for the `SARS-CoV-2_Bottleneck` project. The main goals of this notebook are to characterize: 

1. Concordance between replicate sequencing runs. 
2. Identify samples with poor concordance that should be excluded from the analysis. 
3. Determine the ideal heuristic thresholds for sequencing depth and allele count.
