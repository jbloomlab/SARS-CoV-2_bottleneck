This notebook contains an QC analysis of sequencing runs for the `SARS-CoV-2_Bottleneck` project. The main goals of this notebook are to characterize: 

1. Identify samples and regions of low-depth in the sequencing. 
2. Determine the contribution of extra sequencing to the quality of samples. 
3. Identify any oddities in the sequencing runs.
