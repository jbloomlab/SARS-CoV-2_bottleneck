This notebook contains an QC analysis of sequencing runs for the `SARS-CoV-2_Bottleneck` project. The main goals of this notebook are to characterize: 

1. Identify samples and regions of low-depth in the sequencing. 
2. Determine the contribution of extra sequencing to the quality of samples. 
3. Identify any oddities in the sequencing runs.

```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
require("knitr")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r Required Packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

## ==== Install Required Packages ==== ##

## List of all packages needed -- non-BioManager installed
packages = c("tidyverse", "ggrepel", "plotly")
## Check that packages are installed, if not, install them
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
}
## Packages loading
invisible(lapply(c(packages), library, character.only = TRUE))
