This notebook contains a genomic coverage analysis of sequencing runs for the `SARS-CoV-2_Bottleneck` project. The main goals of this notebook are to characterize: 

1. What percent of the genome is covered by an adequeate depth for variant calling in each run.
2. Are there unsual patterns of coverage that suggest underlying biases?  
3. Identify samples of low coverage to exclude from the final analysis.
