This notebook contains an analysis of the transmission bottleneck for the `SARS-CoV-2_Bottleneck` project. The main goals of this notebook are to characterize: 

1. Identify the degree to which varaints are shared between individuals on the boat. 
2. Determine if there are sepecific characteristics of these variants. 
3. Calculate a pair-wise transmission bottleneck with a beta-binomial model.
